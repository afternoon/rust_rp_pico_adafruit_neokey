# Demo of Adafruit NeoKey 1x4 with Rust and Raspberry Pi Pico

This demo app shows how to use [alexeden/adafruit-seesaw](https://github.com/alexeden/adafruit-seesaw) to talk to the NeoKey 1x4 over I2C.

If you have a device connected locally, use `cargo run` to build and flash the app to the your device.

For more information about building apps for the Raspberry Pi Pico with Rust, see [rp-rs/rp-hal](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal/).
